Business Landscape

Company’s field of business

Business Productivity and predictive maintenance in manufacturing.

Predictive maintenance technique makes use of analytics and data to forecast the likelihood of equipment failure, enabling maintenance to be planned ahead of time and increasing overall reliability [10]. The use of predictive maintenance is expected to undergo substantial changes in the upcoming years due to data availability and technological advancements.

To predict how and when malfunctions and breakdowns are likely to happen, manufacturers employ artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate data from sensors and factory floor equipment. This implies that they can guarantee that the tools and replacement parts required for maintenance will be available to guarantee a prompt resolution. It also implies that companies can adjust their scheduling and logistical planning to better correctly anticipate the amount of downtime that can be anticipated in a given process or activity. To gain crucial insights into the condition of production machinery, machine learning algorithms can interpret data from vibrations, thermal imaging, operating efficiency, and analysis of oils and liquids in machinery. Pepsi and Colgate, use technology designed by AI startup, Augury to detect problems with manufacturing machinery before they cause breakdowns.

Core metrics for measuring success/Key Performance Index (KPI)

Key performance indicators for maintenance can be divided into two groups: leading and lagging [12]. Maintenance KPIs come in a few different categories, such as leading and lagging indicators [13]. Leading indicators are employed to anticipate shifts or patterns that facilitate performance in the future. Metrics, like expected vs. actual performance and preventive maintenance (PM) compliance, are examples of these. To compare historical performance to objectives, lagging indicators are employed. Lagging indicators are maintenance measures such as Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).
The majority of Successful companies monitor a combination of leading and lagging metrics. Among the crucial maintenance indicators to pay attention to are:
1. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)
The average interval between malfunctions is known as the mean time between failures, or MTBF. This metric is employed in the analysis of complicated asset safety and equipment design. The ratio of operational hours to failures is the basis for this calculation. By closely monitoring this KPI and related performance measures like uptime and downtime, organizations may maximize their Preventive Maintenance (PM) programs.
2. Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
When handling unscheduled maintenance, it is essential to know the typical time required to identify and fix equipment malfunctions. This measure takes into consideration how long it takes to cool down or start up again. MTTR can lead to missed orders or business goals, which can have a big effect on an organization's bottom line.
3. Planned vs. Unplanned Maintenance
Any scheduled maintenance procedure to minimize downtime is referred to as planned maintenance. Any unforeseen maintenance activity, frequently the outcome of equipment failure, is referred to as unplanned maintenance. Monitoring scheduled versus unplanned maintenance enables you to assess the program's effectiveness.
4. Planned Maintenance Percentage
Identifying inefficient operations is made easier when you know what percentage of all maintenance jobs are scheduled. The percentage of all hours spent on scheduled tasks within a certain time frame is the expression used to represent this maintenance measure. A value of more than 70% is deemed satisfactory, and more than 90% is regarded as "world-class maintenance."
5. Preventive Maintenance (PM) Compliance
The percentage of jobs that were finished on time and within a set window of time is known as PM Compliance. It's an additional indicator for assessing the consistency and resource conservation of a preventive maintenance (PM) program. PM tasks should, as a general rule, be finished within 10% of the planned maintenance period. Monthly PMs must be finished three days after the deadline.
6. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
The sum of an asset's performance, availability, and quality in terms of how it functions regularly determines how well your maintenance procedures are working. OEE offers a well-informed, data-driven assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of your maintenance procedures. Aim for a value of 100% to reduce item defects.

Recommendations

The Augury mobile app has limited functionality and is only utilized during the installation process. Updating or developing a mobile app for iOS and Android that will allow users to access comprehensive analytics, monitor sensor data, and get real-time warnings. This smooth link guarantees effective maintenance operations and improves team communication (Mobile App Offering and Capability)

For predictive maintenance to be effective, data gathering accuracy and frequency are essential. The standard for Augury data gathering is once every sixty minutes. More data points can be collected at a faster rate—for example, once every five or ten minutes—which will enable more accurate and timely insights and better monitoring. This is especially helpful in dangerous or difficult-to-reach places. It improves efficiency and safety by enabling constant monitoring without the need for proximity (AI Data Capture Frequency and standard)

It is also crucial to have a wide communication range between the sensor and the gateway. Due to their 2.4GHz communication technology, Augury's range is restricted to 50 feet inside a plant and 300 feet in a straight line. This results in the need for additional gateways, which raises complexity and costs and adds to the number of potential points of failure. (Communication Gateway Range)
